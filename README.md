# Web-Scraping-via-Beautifulsoup-and-Create-as-a-Database-via-SQLite-
I scraped book information from the "bestselling books" category on the Amazon website via Python Beautifulsoup. I separated these informations as "book title, author, price" and "evaluation score". I tabulated all this informations with SQLite and saved them as a database. I also saved it as JSON.
